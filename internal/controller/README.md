### Controller Layer

Controller layer is responsible for handling the incoming HTTP requests and sending the response back to the client. 
It sits between the service layer (which holds the business logic) and the client (which can be a web browser or a mobile app).

This layer is bifurcated into two parts, one handling the user related requests and the other handling the admin related requests.
