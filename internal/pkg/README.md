### Pkg Directory

Pkg is a short form of package. This is a popular way in golang projects to keep the utility kind of code.
It is a bad practice in golang to create a util package (https://dave.cheney.net/2019/01/08/avoid-package-names-like-base-util-or-common).

For example, this directory contains time related utility functions that are required to be used in our code.
